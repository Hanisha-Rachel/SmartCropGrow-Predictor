# SmartCropSell-Predictor 🌾
_An AI + ML + IoT project to help farmers identify the best time and market to sell crops profitably._

---

## 1) Abstract
SmartCropSell-Predictor is designed to support farmers with data-driven insights. The system combines **IoT-based data collection** (environmental and crop conditions) with **AI/ML models** trained in Jupyter Notebook to recommend the best time and location for selling crops. This project aims to reduce market uncertainty and improve farmer profitability.

## 2) Problem Statement
Farmers face major challenges due to:
- Price fluctuations in agricultural markets  
- Lack of awareness about demand and supply trends  
- No proper tools for real-time data collection (weather, soil, crop conditions)  
These issues lead to reduced profits and poor decision-making.

---

## 3) Proposed Solution
The solution integrates:
- **IoT sensors** for capturing real-time environmental and crop condition data  
- **Machine Learning models** for analyzing historical market and environmental patterns  
- **AI-driven recommendations** for the best selling time and market  
- Implementation and testing done through **Jupyter Notebook**

---

## 4) Objectives
- Collect crop/environmental data using IoT devices  
- Train ML models on collected + historical data  
- Predict the best **time** to sell  
- Recommend the most profitable **market/location**  
- Support farmers with reliable, data-backed decisions  

---

## 5) Methodology / Approach
**Step 1 – IoT Data Collection**  
- Sensors: Soil moisture, temperature, humidity (simulated or real IoT devices)  
- Stored for analysis  

**Step 2 – Data Preprocessing in Jupyter Notebook**  
- Clean, normalize, and prepare datasets  

**Step 3 – Machine Learning Modeling**  
- Train ML models (Regression / Classification)  
- Evaluate using metrics (Accuracy, RMSE, MAE, etc.)  

**Step 4 – Prediction**  
- Generate recommendations on best time and location to sell  

**Step 5 – Validation**  
- Compare predicted outcomes with real/available data  

---

## 6) Tech Stack / Tools Used
- **AI & ML:** Python (Scikit-learn / basic ML libraries)  
- **IoT:** Sensors (soil, temperature, humidity) / Simulated IoT data  
- **Notebook:** Jupyter Notebook for implementation & analysis  
- **Others:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib for visualization  

---

## 7) System Architecture / Workflow

The project integrates **IoT sensors**, **AI/ML models**, and **Jupyter Notebook** for analysis.  

**Workflow Steps:**
1. IoT devices collect environmental & crop-related data (e.g., soil moisture, temperature).  
2. Data is stored and preprocessed (handled in Jupyter Notebook).  
3. Machine Learning models are trained on historical + IoT data.  
4. Predictions are generated for the best **selling time** and **profitable market**.  
5. Results are displayed with visualizations and recommendations.
